# nwis Filtering Functions

Often the nwis that comes from long records of stream observation are noisy. The records of dicharge, width, depth and velocity from gauges although being extremly valuble require carfull consideration, and filttering due to reasons including but not limited to:

1- Changes in measurement instruments

2- Changes in location of measurements (slight deviations form cross sections can result in significant differences in geometry)

3- Changes in river due to flooding and etc. (river meandering)

While the FHG algorithm implemented in this package can deal with this noise through the hybrid the `OLS --> NLS --> NSGA2 --> combo` fitting method, it is also possible, and even advisable, to filter the nwis prior to fitting.

Here we will illustrate the packaged methods. An assumption of _all_ filtering methods is that if it reduces the nwisset to less then 10 observations, a warning is emited and the input nwis is returned. The intiall step in filtering is to screened for any negative, inf values. Negative value in observations is often associated with gagues that are located in backwater zones and are affected by the coastal processes including sea level changes, tides and storm surge that can extend hundreds of kilometers inland.

## 1. Median Absolute Deviation (mad)

An iterative outlier detection procedure can be run iteritivly on the residuals of linear regressions for each relationship following the procedure described in the [HyG nwisset](https://zenodo.org/record/7868764). Values of log-transformed TW, V, and Y residuals falling outside a specified median absolute deviation (MAD) are excluded with each pass until no outliers are left.

This approach can be implemented using `mad_filter`:

```{r}
load("data/nwis.rda")
mad_nwis = mad_filter(nwis, envelope = 3)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = mad_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "red") + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = mad_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "red", alpha = .5) + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = mad_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "red", alpha = .5)

```

## 2. Temporal

Rivers change with time. To minimize the effects of long-term channel evolution it can be advantageous to limit the records to the most recent years. This approach can be implemented using `date_filter`. Users can specify the number of years to keep (in reference to the most recent observation) and whether the maximum flow value should be kept regradless of when it was taken.

```{r}
date_data = date_filter(nwis, years = 5, keep_max = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = date_data, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "red") + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = date_data, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "red", alpha = .5) + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = date_data, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "red", alpha = .5)

```

## 3. Q = vA Assumption

One of the basic assumptions of the AHG relation is that Q = vA where v is velocity, A is cross sectional area, and Q is stream flow. The `qva_filter` can be used to remove measurements that grossly violate this assumption. Within the code, A is assumed to be the product of Y and TW and an allowance can be specific that determines the amount of allows deviation from equality. The default allowance is .05.
 
```{r}
qva_nwis = qva_filter(nwis, allowance = .05)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = qva_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "red") + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = qva_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "red", alpha = .5) + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = qva_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "red", alpha = .5)

```

## 4. NLS prediciton

Through out the development of this package it became evident that the NLS approach, when using OLS estimates as seeds, provided the best relation by relation fit. This approach fits the NLS equations for each provided relationship. This fit is used to predict [V,TW,Y] for all given Q's.  If the actual value is outside the specified allowance (default = +/- 50%) it is removed.

```{r}
nls_nwis = nls_filter(nwis, allowance = .5)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = nls_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "red") + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = nls_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "red", alpha = .5) + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = nls_nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "red", alpha = .5)

# Chaining Commands

Multiple filtering approaches can be chained together to isolate a representative nwisset from the complete archive. For example, we could reduce the complete nwisset to a 10 year record that respects the Q=vA assumption and has no nwis outside of 3 MAD in any relation:

```{r}
xf = nwis %>% 
  # Keep the most recent 10 year
  date_filter(year = 10, keep_max = TRUE) %>% 
  # Keep nwis within 3 Median absolute deviations (log residuals)
  mad_filter() %>% 
  # Keep nwis that respects the Q = vA criteria w/in allowance
  qva_filter()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = xf, aes(x = Q, y = Y), color = "red") + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = xf, aes(x = Q, y = TW), color = "red") + 
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = nwis, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = xf, aes(x = Q, y = V), color = "red")

```

# Significance

The relationship between all supplied log transformed variables are computed.  If the p-value of any of these is less then the supplied p-value an error message is emitted and it can be assumed that no statistical relationship exists between Q-{TW,V,Y}.

```{r}
s = significance_check(nwis)
