# Summary

### Background

In the field of hydrology it is common to express the behavior of a river channel at a given cross section using power law equations relating top width (TW), mean depth (Y), and velocity (V) to a given discharge (Q). Collectively these equations define the "at a station hydraulic geometry" (AHG) [@leopold1953hydraulic].

$$
TW = a *Q^b
$$

$$
Y = c*Q^f
$$

$$
V = k*Q^m
$$

A set of AHG relations applies to within-bank flows at a specific cross section and assumes the channel characteristics do not significantly change with discharge. Under these assumptions, two continuity conditions determine if mass is conserved in the system:

$$
Q = TW路Y路V
$$

and therefore:

$$
\begin{eqnarray} b + f + m &=& 1\\ a路c路k &=& 1 \\ \end{eqnarray}
$$

When either of these is violated, the AHG's equations will cause mass imbalances in computations.

### Software

Estimating AHG's has predominately occurred on a location-by-location basis with site specific knowledge guiding the data used and the validation of the outputs. As efforts seek to extend to coverage of hydrologic and flood inundation mapping (FIM) models the need to estimate these relations from disparate and often noisy datasets is increasingly important.

`FHGestimation` is an R package [@r-project] aimed to provide 3 capabilities:

1.  Tools to estimate single and full system AHG relations using a robust estimation techniques that enforces flow continuity and minimizes total system error (`fhg_estimate`). This is accomplished by introducing a hybrid approach that supplements the traditional Ordinary Least Squares approach, with a nonlinear Least Square regression, Evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-2; [@mco]), and ensemble modeling approach to ensures flow continuity is met and error is minimized regardless of the input data.

2.  Methods to filter outliers based on time (`date_filter`), mass conservation (`qva_filter`), and statistical detection (`mad_filter`, `nls_filter`).

3.  Formalize, in code, many of the concepts derived in [@dingman2018field] that relate AHG coefficients to cross-section hydraulics and geometry. These include (`cross_section`, `compute_hydraulic_params`, `compute_n`).

The package documentation includes several examples on the theory, design, and application of this tool set.

The first stable version of `FHGestimation` was made available in 2019 and applied to an aggregated dataset of USGS manual field measurements. Since then, it has been actively developed to better understand and quantify these fundamental relationships in the face of noisy, large, tabular data sources. Applications of the software have been used to support PhD research at UC Santa Barbara, a National Science Foundation project focused on delivering actionable flood forecasts from the NOAA National Water Model [@johnson2022knowledge], NOAA Office of Water Prediction's efforts to develop a 3D hydrography to improve national hydralic and hydrologic and flood prediction, and bolster USGS and NOAA co-agency National Hydrologic Geospatial Fabric [@referencefabric], [@blodgett2021mainstems], [@blodgett2023generating], [@blodgett2023generating]]

# Statement of need

Large scale models simulating river flow are critical for forecasting water availability, drought, and flood inundation. Such models must represent the shape of river channels in some generalized way.

While hydraulic geometry relationships have been extensively studied, they remain unquantified for the majority of stream reaches across the country. Consequently, large-scale models frequently use simplistic approaches that impact the accuracy of streamflow estimates [@hess-26-6121-2022] [@johnson2023comprehensive] and flood forecasting ([@zheng2018river]. [@maidment2014national], [@johnson2019integrated], [@fim]). At NOAA, these relationships have been based on trapezoidal geometries (e.g. [@wrfhydro]) derived from drainage area assumptions (e.g. [@blackburn2017development]).

Other efforts have aimed to calculate, and synthesize river channel data at a large scale in the United States (e.g. [@enzminger_thomas_l_2023_7868764], [@afshari_shahab_2019_2558565]). However, each of these relied on traditional OLS fitting methods AND data preprocessing [@afshari2017statistical]. Additinally, while both efforts produced valuable data products, the software used is not shared or was too difficult to redeploy over alternative data.

This package is designed to handle and resolve the following challenges with hydraulic data that need to be overcome to advance the science of large scale hydrologic modeling:

1.  Data is often distributed without consistent structure
2.  Data is noisy and hard to fit with traditional methods
3.  Data is tabular, making the development of efficient regional and continental datasets a challenge.

The aim of this software is that data from a variety of sources can be aggregated and used to estimate hydraulic equations that reduce data volume, enforce continuity, and allow for representing uncertainty in an open source, reproducible way.

# Example of use

`FHGestimation` is available on [GtiHub](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/FHGestimation) and can be installed as follows:

``` r
#install.packages(remotes)
remotes::install.packages("mikejohnson51/FHGestimation")
library(FHGestimation)
```

This example shows how the package can be used to (1) remove data outliers based on time criteria and an NLS envelope (2) fit AHG parameters using our hybrid modeling approach and (3) estimate and plot the shape of the associated cross-section with an area-depth relation.

``` r
data = readRDS(../insta)  %>% 
  date_filter(10, keep_max = TRUE) %>% 
  nls_filter(allowance = .5) 
  
ahg_fit = fhg_estimation()

shape = compute_hydraulic_params(ahg_fit)

cs = cross_section(r = shape$r,  TW = max(data$TW), Ymax = max(data$Y))
```

As a proof of concept, this approach was applied to the synthetic rating curves generated from the [NOAA-OWP/inundation-mapping](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/inundation-mapping) repository ([@fim]). The package allowed the size of their rating curve database to be reduced by 99.68% and maintained average accuracy within 0.4% nRMSE of the source data. Further, the reduction to a consistent AHG formulation allows them to be more interoperable with efforts like [@enzminger_thomas_l_2023_7868764], [@afshari_shahab_2019_2558565] while also providing a key training data for more advanced prediction methods.

# Acknowledgements

The development of this package began in 2017 following the CUAHSI/NOAA OWP Summer Institute and clear evidence channel shape may be a limiting factor in National Water Model Performance.

The algorithm and implementation began as a graduate school project between friends at UC Santa Barbara and UMass Amherst and has since evolved to provide an open source utility for robust large scale data synthesis and evaluation. Funding from the National Science Foundation (Grants 1937099, 2033607) provided time to draft [@preprint] and apply an early version of this software to the Continental Flood Inundation Mapping (CFIM) synthetic rating curve dataset [@cfim]. Funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Water Prediction supported the addition of data filtering and hydraulic estimation, improved documentation, and code hardening. We are grateful to all involved.
