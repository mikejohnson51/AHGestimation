\title{Implements filtering by median absolute deviation}
\usage{
mad_filter(df, envelope = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data.frame with at least a Q and one other AHG field (Y. TW, V).}

\item{envelope}{MAD envelope}
}
\value{
data.frame
}
\description{
An iterative outlier detection procedure is run based on to the linear regression residuals.
Values of log-transformed TW, V, and Y residuals falling outside a specified median absolute deviation (MAD) envelope are excluded.
Regression coefficients were recalculated and the outlier detection procedure was reapplied until no outliers are detected. This method
 was identified in \href{https://zenodo.org/record/7868764}{HyG}
